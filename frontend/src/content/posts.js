Iron Psalm has grown from a weekend prototype into a sprawling realm stitched together by code, caffeine, and far-too-many sticky notes.
With this blog we want to lift the hood and show you what's humming underneath: design notes, balance changes, concept art, and the odd poem that fell out of the lore vault.

Over the coming weeks you can expect deep-dives on the action-point system, AI-assisted lore generation, and the cursed bug that once turned every villager into a turnip. Stay tuned â€” and thank you for journeying with us.

Creating the visual identity for Iron Psalm has been a journey through shadow and light. Every piece of concept art starts with a simple question: what does this place feel like?

Our process begins with rough sketches, often just a few lines that capture the essence of a location. The village, for instance, started as nothing more than a collection of rooftops against a mountain backdrop.

From there, we layer in the details that make each location unique. The monastery's spires weren't always so imposing - they grew organically from the need to feel both welcoming and intimidating.

The final pieces often surprise us. What began as simple architectural studies become living, breathing spaces that players will inhabit for hours.

This iterative process ensures that every visual element serves the story we're telling. Nothing is arbitrary in Iron Psalm's world.
